		<p>Hate crimes in the United States are peaking once again. There were 7,314 hate crimes in 2019, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hate-crimes-rise-fbi-data-ebbcadca8458aba96575da905650120d">An analysis by the Associated Press</a> noted that hate crimes in 2019 were the highest in over a decade. The annual report from the FBI defines hate crimes by an offenderâ€™s motivations such as a bias against a particular race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or gender.</p>

		<p> "Two things are propelling this. One, hate had become mainstream. People express it out in the open," said Kevin Borgeson, a criminologist at Salem State University who has been studying hate crimes and hate groups since 1999. "The other thing propelling a wave of hate is economics. Even though the economy has been good under the Trump administration, not everyone has prospered."</p>
